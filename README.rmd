# Purpose

These materials were developed for the 2023 UMass Dartmouth QuantFish Seminar Series by, myself, [Em Markowitz](https://emilyhmarkowitz.github.io/emilyhmarkowitz/). 

# Outline

## Presenation materials

 - Final presentation slides will be posted after the seminar. In the mean time, those with access have the [google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-AbDrGG_8Vfxh_WacMPbPQuqneMvFNh6HCQrjSDLBUs/edit?usp=sharing). 
 - Script examples are available in this [repository](`r link_repo`). 
 - The first three examples are based on entries to this [google form](https://forms.gle/stVH7EdhwH4n8azz7) where participants will 'MadLib' a story together. 

## Example 1

Find the code for example 1 [here](https://github.com/EmilyMarkowitz-NOAA/automated-reporting-ex/tree/main/code1). Run this code from the `template1.qmd` script. 

 - Dynamically fill in a simple, 1-template MadLib example for one entry
 - Use code chunks and in-line code calls. 
 - Apply some simple formatting (e.g., bolding, italics)

## Example 2

Find the code for example 2 [here](https://github.com/EmilyMarkowitz-NOAA/automated-reporting-ex/tree/main/code2). Run this code from the `template1_parent.qmd` script. 

 - Cycle data through parent and child quarto docs
 - Naming chunks
 - Using local functions in in-line code chunks
 
## Example 3

Find the code for example 3 [here](https://github.com/EmilyMarkowitz-NOAA/automated-reporting-ex/tree/main/code3). Run this code from the `run3.r` script. 

 - Call `.qmd` from `.r` script
 - Play around with `YAML` settings
 - Apply table and figure cross referencing
 - Apply citation cross referencing
 - Use citation style library (`.csl`) 
 - Use bibtex file (`.bib`, contains citations)

## Example 4

Find the code for example 4 [here](https://github.com/EmilyMarkowitz-NOAA/automated-reporting-ex/tree/main/code4). Run this code from the `run4.r` script. 

Here we will start to work with some real data and annual reporting on snailfish catches in the eastern Bering Sea bottom trawl survey. Data is publicly available from the Fisheries One Stop Shop (FOSS, @FOSSAFSCData) and in this [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/gap_public_data).
